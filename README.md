Launch Bay Next
![Typescript](https://github.com/andrelind/launch-bay-next-web/workflows/Typescript/badge.svg?branch=master)
===============
Another squad builder...?

Well, I've had the Launch Bay Next mobile app available since the release of X-Wing Second Edition and a bit further down the path I found out that I could reuse most of my components from the app (written in React Native) to be used on the web!

Said and done, I did a quick conversion of some key components and this is it...

It's not even close on par feature-wise with the mobile app, but most features will probably be available here also (at some point).


Building
========

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org)
2. Install [Yarn](https://legacy.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
3. `yarn install` to install all dependencies
4. `yarn dev` to get the app running
